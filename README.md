# OOP-Light

A preprocessor-based OOP extension for SQF.

## Main features
1. Based on ARMA's default preprocessor.You don't need any extra software to use it.
2. Low performance impact. Overhead for calling functions and accessing member variables is minimized.
3. Run-time variable\method\class access violation checks which can be disabled to increase performance after you're done debugging.
4. Supports most OOP features: methods, member variables, virtual functions, inheritance.

## Documentation
To be done.

## Current state
Seems to be mostly working. I am actively using it so I will be fixing errors in the process.
